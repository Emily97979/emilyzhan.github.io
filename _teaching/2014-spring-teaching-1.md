As people turn to social media to share ideas and connect with others, there has been great excitement but skepticism about these platformsâ€™ role in democratizing information and allowing for more participatory news making. 

The social media universe has deeply permeated our personal and political lives in the last decade, from privacy issues to fake news. I want you to be at the center of these conversations as you progress in your academic and professional careers.

This course aims to provide a firm theoretical foundation in the current social media scholarship while imparting how these theories relate to media and civic life. The course also explores how scholarly work can be translated into professional practice that makes social media spaces more democratic.
